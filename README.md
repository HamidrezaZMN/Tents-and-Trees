# What-Is-This
"Tents and Trees" is a game that is developed by Gamee. 
Gamee is a game app that is avaible for android too. 
There is even a specific bot for Gamee in Telegram<br>
This game (Tents and Trees) is kinda like sudoku. 
It has several rules and while paying attention to those rules you have to complete each level<br>
I have made a program with python that gives the board and outputs the way to end the game<br>

# how-does-it-work
What I've done is that I exactly translated our brains into code. 
To give an example, one of the ways that we find a tent is that we check for each row or column if there is 
an intersecion between the ways that the row or column is filled. 
I've done this for every other method that I use to finish the level
